3. **Hallway**: A passage that leads to critical places.
4. **Erdos Laptop**: The location where you must enter the password to retrieve the key.
5. **Aliens**: The final confrontation. Use the correct answer to save Earth or face its destruction.

1. **Answer Key**: The correct solution to the Ramsey number problem. This will save Earth.
2. **AI-Generated Solution**: A wrong answer that will lead to Earth's destruction.

## Code Design

The game is designed using a combination of Swift `structs`, `enums`, and `protocols`:

- **Structs** are used to represent both `Locations` and `Items`. Each location has a name, description, directions, and an optional item.
- The **`Interactable` protocol** ensures that items like the Answer Key and AI-Generated Solution have a name, description, and an interaction behavior when picked up.
- **Optionals** are used for the `playerItem` (the item the player picks up) and the `currLocation.item` (whether an item is available in the current location).
- Game logic controls player movement, item interaction, and the flow of the narrative based on player input.
